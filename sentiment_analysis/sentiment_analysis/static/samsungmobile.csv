"The phone is good for regular use. Comes with enormous battery of 6000 mah which supports all your daily errands in a single charge. The back camera is good while I think front camera could be made better. It supports type c charger only and it is strongly recommend to use adaptible original charger only, to save battery health and to avoid heating issue.

Awesome product good deal,5
Top notch specs.Need to buy charger seperately for full support of 45W.It charges within 60 minutes most of time and screen on time is 6-7 hours.The fort is nearly 10-15 kms away from my home and zoom and clearty after taking pics it's just awesome.Had to buy this one as it gives few more features than Apple. Portraits are good too. Overall great but little pricier as we compare to US prices.,5

"The Galaxy A34 5G is a meaningful upgrade over its predecessor that cuts unnecessary parts and improves in just the right areas to transform into a well-rounded phone for its price range. Its strongest characteristics are without a doubt the amazingly long battery life and the long software support, which is not standard for the mid-range market. In other words, if you are searching for a phone that would not break the bank and nevertheless last you for 3 or 4 years, this is a great option.P...",5

Been using for a month* Display is the best* Speakers are too good. Best for multimedia usage  because of the display and speakers. * Battery lasts upto a day for medium use.
